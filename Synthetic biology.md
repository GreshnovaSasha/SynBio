Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline where practitioners of it want to design systems, predict their behavior, and be able 
to control that behavior, often with external stimuli.
These systems or subsystems can be **reused**.

Inspired by an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)

These physical parts can be arranged to create **logic gates** or other fundamental components, which can be organized into **modules** 
carrying out some **functions**, such as remembering information, sensing or changing the environment. These modules make up large 
**systems**, which can be organized into networks

Same workflow:
* engeneer the curcuit that perform specific function
* analyse the curcuit with computational tools
* test in the cells
* several iterations of design may be required
* debugging
* analysis of results

Synthetic biology is different from bioengineering in using of technologies:

* Recombinant DNA
* PCR
* DNA sequencing
* **DNA construction**
* **Abstraction**
* **Standardization**

What is standard biological part?
[BioBrick](http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page)

Standrats for assembly

As engeneers we want systems to be **reliable**, **specific**, and **predictable**.

Challenges of engeneering in biology

* Noise
* Genetic mutations
* Cell death
* Incomplete models
* Cellular contex
