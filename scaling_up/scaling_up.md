## Scaling up

Combinatoinal circuits

Most functions are alredy implemented in the cells

[Verilog](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)

NOR and NAND gates -> any digital logic circuits

Protein-protein interaction are difficult to engineer

Possible failure/problems: steric interference, different inducer levels at which each NOR gates turns on for different promoters, different NOR gates are not orthogonal to each other
