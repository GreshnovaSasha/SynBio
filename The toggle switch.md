## The toggle switch 

![Togggle switch](https://github.com/GreshnovaSasha/SynBio/blob/master/Toggle%20switch.png)

Consist of two negative feedback loops

Actually, is a positive loop

Negative times negative is positive!

Bi-stable switch

Logic: A OR NOT(B)

Inducers (A) [can turn off these repressions] generally are low.

Repressors are outputs. 

![logic for the toggle](https://github.com/GreshnovaSasha/SynBio/blob/master/the%20toggle%20switch%20logic.png)

Switching is accomplished by transiently introducing an inducer of the currently active repressor

If two operators were one that won't work.

Requirements 
* sigmoid function

**Dynamics**

Data extrapolation

**Mathematical model**

![mathmatical model](https://github.com/GreshnovaSasha/SynBio/blob/master/G-C%20toggle%20model.png)

Hill-function
The repressor-promoter binding constant is taken as one

a1 and a2 are the normalized maximum synthesis rates, and gamma and beta are the cooperativity of the repressor-promoter binding.

Biological noise

![Noise](https://github.com/GreshnovaSasha/SynBio/blob/master/noise.png)

n is a number of molucules

## The oscillator

![Oscillator](https://github.com/GreshnovaSasha/SynBio/blob/master/Oscillator.png)

Consist of three negative feedback loops

The two genes no longer directly interact; having intermediary delay. 

Negative times negative times negative is negative
