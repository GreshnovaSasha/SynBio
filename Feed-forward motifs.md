# Feed forward motifs

**Feed-forward circuits** have a network structure in which some starting node initiates a signal through multiple branches 
that later converge. 
**Toggles** are systems that can switch between two or more states. Toggles allow us to store memory of the last input that the system was given. 
**Oscillators** are important circuits that have a periodic nature. The output of these devices increases and decreases over time, 
leading to interesting sinusoidal-like behavior. Oscillators are particularly important for timing and creating clocks.
